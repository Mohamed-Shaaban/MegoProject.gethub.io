<p>Description:</p>

<pre><code>  As we all know its hard to find your car in a big parking lot within the rush hours. Therefore we developed a program that detect and saved your parking slot once you enter the parking lot. Our target audience would be any one who uses parking lots.
</code></pre>

<p>Motivation.</p>

<pre><code>  Out motivation is to help elder people who having a problem to remember their parking slot. By developing this app they now can save their parking slot and retrieve it from their cell phone easily so that they do not spend several mins maybe more searching for their car location in big parking lot which is really exhausted.
</code></pre>

<p>Use-case Senior: </p>

<pre><code>  Its 4 PM and Megan heading out from work to her car in the big crowded parking lot. She is trying to find her car but she could not due too the size of the parking lot also the huge amount of cars in it. Few minutes later, Megan finally found it but she felt really exhausted. She spoke with her friend who told her about our parking App she decide to give it a try. Now every time Megan entering her parking lot she use our app which calculate and save the parking slot location. Megan thanks her friends for telling her about our app.
</code></pre>

<p>Future Work:</p>

<p>Odu parking app:
Connect The smartphone to the Database or system for the garage and update slot status based on detecting whether or not smartphone in garage.</p>
